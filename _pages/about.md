Welcome to my page! I'm Renyun Li (李仁赟/yūn/). My past research, internship, and education have intricately woven an electric and theoretical background, encompassing 3D Vision, segmentation, compression, and SLAM. Currently, I'm working as a MLE at [Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR)](https://www.cibr.ac.cn/about/generalization?language=en) with [Dr. Tatsuo Okubo](https://cibr.ac.cn/science/team/detail/975?language=en). Besides, I'm also the Co-Founder of [fAIshion](https://www.faishion.ai/).

Before that, I got my M.S. degree in ECE from NYU. I was fortunate to be advised by advised by [Prof. Yao Wang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang) in [Video Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/people/), working on 3D point cloud segmentation, motion estimation, and compressing. My graduate project is to design a PointNet-based model infused with motion estimation for human 3D point cloud segmentation, paving the way for the compression of 3D video based on this.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, my academic journey took an unexpected gap year (20'-21'). I joined NXP Semiconductors as a Software Engineer Intern in Edge Processing team, working on 3D Vision with Mingkai Hu. After that, I joined [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) as a visiting scholar. Led by [Prof. Jianyu Chen](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/), we worked on RL, POMDP, and 3D Vision.

Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering at Tianjin University. Collaborated with Prof. Tiegen Liu, we worked on 3D point cloud and Optics. During my undergrad, I participated in two papers published in SPIE and Applied Physics, five patents, and received 33 honors and awards, including 5 at national level.

Fun fact: I had to finish 4 yrs credits requirement of ECE in 2 yrs due to the inevitable mistake of the department. Therefore, I earned 100.5 credits during my 3rd year of undergrad. This experience cultivated my multitasking abilities and nurtured my profound self-learning skills, which now serve as invaluable assets in pursuing higher education, internships, and research.

Spare time: Apart from academics, I particularly enjoy outdoor sports such as hiking, kayaking, skiing, and regular workouts. My bench press, deadlift, and squat stand at 100kg, 160kg, and 180kg respectively. Aerobic exercises provide tranquility, while anaerobic workouts serve as a way to alleviate stress, offering a healthy outlet from academic demands. Additionally, my musical journey commenced with the melodies of the piano when I was 9 years old.
